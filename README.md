# Kinsta Must Use (MU) Plugin

A simple mirror of the official Kinsta Mu Plugin with added Composer/[Bedrock](https://github.com/roots/bedrock) support.

For latest version/info please see the official [Kinsta MU Plugin page](https://kinsta.com/help/kinsta-mu-plugin/).

## Installing with Composer (for Bedrock)

1. Add this plugin repo to `repositories`in your Bedrock `composer.json` file:
    ```diff
      "repositories": {
        "wpackagist": {
          "type": "composer",
          "url": "https://wpackagist.org",
          "only": [
            "wpackagist-plugin/*",
            "wpackagist-theme/*"
          ]
        },
    +   "kinsta-mu-plugins": {
    +     "type": "vcs",
    +     "url": "git@github.com:retlehs/kinsta-mu-plugins"
    +   },
    ```
1. Add the plugin requirement with specific version number (or `*` for latest) to `composer.json`:
    ```diff
      "require": {
        "php": ">=7.4",
        "composer/installers": "^2.0",
        ...
    +   "kinsta/kinsta-mu-plugins": "*",
        ...
      }
    ```
1. Run `composer update` from the Bedrock directory.


## White label

1. The branded **Kinsta Cache** sidebar link will be changed to an unbranded **Cache Settings** link.
1. The **Thanks for creating with WordPress and hosting with Kinsta** message near the bottom of the dashboard will be replaced with **Thank you for creating with WordPress**.
1. The Kinsta logo on the **Cache Control** page will be removed or replaced with an image of your choice.

```php
define('KINSTAMU_WHITELABEL', true);
